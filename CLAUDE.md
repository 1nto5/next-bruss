- "test" = use chrome-devtools MCP
- "check in database" = use mongodb MCP
- git operations = git or gh commands
- for each new conversation: run `bun run dev`, retrieve the target address from bash (e.g. http://localhost:3000), and use MCP's chrome-devtools `navigate_page` to open it.
- always respond in English; if a message is in Polish, also provide its English translation
