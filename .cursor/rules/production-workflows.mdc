# Production Workflow Patterns

## Approval Workflows

Many features implement multi-stage approval processes:

### Production Overtime Requests

1. **Request Creation** - Employee submits overtime request
2. **Manager Review** - Department manager approval
3. **HR Review** - HR department final approval
4. **Status Tracking** - Real-time status updates

### Project Management

1. **Project Creation** - Initial project setup
2. **Entry Management** - Time and resource tracking
3. **Summary Generation** - Reporting and analysis

## Workflow State Management

Use consistent status enums across workflows:

```tsx
export type WorkflowStatus = 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'in_progress' | 'completed'
```

## Notification Patterns

- Email notifications for status changes
- Dashboard alerts for pending approvals
- Escalation rules for overdue approvals

## Role-Based Access

- Different interfaces for different user roles
- Manager-specific views for approvals
- HR-specific reporting capabilities
- Employee self-service portals

## Data Export

- Excel exports for reporting
- PDF generation for official documents
- Audit trails for compliance

## Time Tracking

- Shift-based calculations
- Overtime rate calculations
- Holiday and weekend handling
- Multi-shift support
