# Manufacturing Domain Patterns

## Business Context

This application manages manufacturing operations for Bruss automotive parts, including:

- Employee management and production overtime tracking
- Quality deviations and corrective actions (CAPA)
- DMC (Data Matrix Code) tracking for parts
- Oven temperature monitoring for production processes
- Inventory management and article configurations

## Key Domain Entities

### Employees

- Tracked with employee numbers, departments, and roles
- Production overtime requests with approval workflows
- Linked to production data and quality records

### Deviations & CAPA

- Quality deviations with severity levels and corrective actions
- File attachments for documentation
- Status tracking through workflow states
- Area and reason categorization for analysis

### Production Data

- DMC tracking for part traceability
- Oven process monitoring with temperature data
- Article configurations and process parameters
- Box and pallet status tracking

## Manufacturing-Specific UI Patterns

### Data Tables

- Use sortable columns for production data
- Include export functionality for compliance reporting
- Implement filtering by date ranges, departments, and status
- Display critical information prominently (NOK status, overdue items)

### Forms

- Multi-step forms for complex processes (deviation reporting)
- File upload capabilities for documentation
- Validation for manufacturing-specific fields (employee numbers, article codes)
- Real-time status updates

### Dashboards

- Production metrics and KPI displays
- Alert systems for critical issues
- Charts for trend analysis
- Real-time status indicators

## Audio Feedback

- Use audio files (`ok.wav`, `nok.mp3`) for production floor feedback
- Implement sound notifications for critical alerts
- Consider industrial environment noise levels

## Data Validation Patterns

- Validate employee numbers against active employee database
- Check article configurations against current production specs
- Validate date ranges for shift schedules and overtime
- Ensure DMC format compliance for traceability
