- Clearly distinguish between server and client components and use each appropriately.

- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI components for consistent UI design.

Data Fetching & Forms

- Use TanStack Query (react-query) for frontend data fetching.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling.
- Use Zod for schema validation.

State Management & Logic

- Use Zustand for global or shared state.

Backend & Database

- Use direct MongoDB access, e.g., with the official MongoDB Node.js driver.
- Use underscores (_) for MongoDB collection names.

Runtime & Package Management

- Use Bun for running, installing, or managing dependencies in this project.
  Do not use npm or yarn. Bun is required for consistency and performance.
